    <ul>
        <li><h2>Summary</h2></li>
        As of now, I am a programmer in the making and just learning. I have no projects other than this one to post.
        <li><h2>Education</h2></li>
        Most of my eduction in programming is what I have been learning in courses. I also went to school at Peninsula College in Port Angeles, Washington with a major in Spanish. I lived in Venezuela from 1993-1995 and learned Spanish there. I also went to Bellevue College in Bellevue Washington and started the translator program and decided it wasn't what I wanted to do.
        <li><h2>Work Experience</h2></li>
        Right now, the only work experience is what I have practicing and learning from a course on Udemy
        <li><h2>Skills</h2></li>
        I have great problem solving skills which I will demonstrate as my portfoloio grows
